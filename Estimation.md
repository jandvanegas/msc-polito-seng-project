# Estimation approach

Consider the EZWH project as described in YOUR requirement document, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course

# Estimate by size

| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)                    | 150       |
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro)                                     | 4500      |
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) | ~ 4 weeks |

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference

|                                    | Estimated effort | Estimated duration |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| estimate by size                   | 150 hours        | 4 weeks            |
| estimate by product decomposition  | 266 hours        | 2 weeks            |
| estimate by activity decomposition | 255 hours        | 2 weeks            |
